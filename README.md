# COVID-19 Pandemic in Greece: Cases, Deaths, and Vaccination Progress

## Motivation

This notebook aims to provide an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic in **Greece</b>**. Specifically, it explores:
-	The current situation and how the pandemic has evolved since its beginning.
-	How vaccinations are progressing in the country.

This notebook is by no means a complete analysis. Its goal is to paint the general picture of COVID-19 in Greece through various visualisations. 
It is written so that it can be reused for any other country, provided that the country's name exists in all four datasets.

## How to View

Since the notebook is rendered as static HTML files in the repository, its interactive features (Plotly plots) will not be displayed. 
To view the notebook with interactive content you can use nbviewer, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/korfanakis/covid-19-pandemic-in-greece-an-overview) or run it locally.

**Note**: Interactive maps could not be displayed with the nbviewer. Consequently, maps will be displayed as static images using the `svg` renderer. 
To access the interactive version, please visit the notebook on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/korfanakis/covid-19-pandemic-in-greece-an-overview) or run the notebook locally after removing the `svg` rendered from the `fig.show()` command.
